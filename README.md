GPIO Driver
================================

Introduction
This repository contains a unified GPIO driver library for AVR microcontrollers, designed to simplify the process of configuring, reading from, and writing to GPIO pins. The library supports multiple ports (PORT_B, PORT_C, PORT_D) and provides functions to initialize pins, set their direction (input/output), and toggle their state (HIGH/LOW). It is intended to be used in embedded systems development with AVR-based platforms.

Key Features:
Easy configuration of GPIO pins.
Supports multiple ports (PORT_B, PORT_C, PORT_D).
Functions for setting pins as input/output and writing/reading HIGH/LOW states.
Installation
